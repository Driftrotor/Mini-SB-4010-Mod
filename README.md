# Mini-SB-4010-Mod
 This mod adds 4010 cooling to your Mini SB

This started with the simple challange from my father to fit 4010 part cooling fans into the Mini SB.

From this is set some basic rules...

1. keep the original look of the Mini SB
2. keep the original homing (this alows us to keep it as it is)
3. keep the printing area to 120 x 120

The ALPHA test (on my Printables) was great and i had some really good feedback from this.
from the feedback i was more able to correct any possible issues other users experianced.
wire routing has now been optimised and some asthetics have been corrected to properly represent the original Mini SB.
the porting for the 4010 blower were taken from the oringinal 3010's and adapted for the larger 4010's output and an additional port hole was created to get more air behind the nozzle. (an area that the Mini SB suffers)

Working hard to keep the original 120 x 120 print area was difficault. The fans were pushed back as far as possible and in the end because of wiring routing i had to sacrifice some Y traval. (3.5mm)
So print area would be 120 x 116.5 if using this Mod.

This Mod is now in BETA TEST as some things will no doubt change as further optimisations are added.
For now though i am happy with the model and have releast the CAD for others to work on and modify. (creditation would be awesome if you do mod)

If you have any more feedback it would be great!
